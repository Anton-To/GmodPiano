This program can play midi files and also connect to take input from midi devices.

* Notes can be transposed one octave up or down using "+" and "-" buttons.
* Mode button toggles between file mode where you can select a file to be played and device mode where you can connect a physical midi instrument and use it to control an in-game piano.
* Number on bottom right of the window is a delay between key presses. Incresing it might improve playing quality on servers with high latency.

I'm not a professional programmer so plese dont mind the code quality.
