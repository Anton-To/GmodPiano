# Other info
  * You can test how good the midi track sounds on this website https://virtualpiano.net/
  * Notes can be transposed one octave up or down using "+" and "-" buttons.
  * Number on bottom right of the window is a delay between key presses. Increasing it might improve playing quality on servers with high latency but increasing it too much will make fast paced songs sound worse. To change it type in the new number and press Enter

I'm not a professional programmer so please dont mind the code quality.
